#CRUD in Django:
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations that can 
be performed on any data entity. In the context of Django, which is a web framework for 
building web applications using Python, these operations are commonly associated with 
database interactions.

#BigQuery in Django:
BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse provided by Google Cloud. 
It allows you to run super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. 
In the context of Django, you might interact with BigQuery using Django models and external packages
designed for BigQuery integration.
