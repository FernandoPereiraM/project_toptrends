DOCKER + DJANGO/PYTHON + ANGULAR + POSTGRESS + BIGQUERY API

#Overview
how these components interact:
1) Docker containers encapsulate and deploy your Django/Python backend and Angular frontend.
2) Django serves as the backend application, handling business logic, interacting with the PostgreSQL database, and potentially making use of the BigQuery API for certain functionalities.
3) Angular, as the frontend, interacts with the Django backend to provide a dynamic and interactive user interface.
